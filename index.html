        <h2>Understanding Cognitive Distortions:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>All-or-Nothing Thinking:</strong> Seeing things in black and white, with no middle ground. You view situations as all good or all bad, without considering the shades of gray.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Catastrophizing:</strong> Exaggerating the negative aspects of a situation and expecting the worst possible outcome, even when it's unlikely to happen.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Mind-Reading:</strong> Assuming you know what others are thinking or feeling without sufficient evidence, often leading to misinterpretations.
            </li>
           <li>
                <strong>Overgeneralization:</strong> Drawing broad negative conclusions based on one or a few isolated incidents.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Labeling:</strong> Using negative labels to describe oneself or others based on mistakes or behavior.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Personalization:</strong> Taking responsibility for events or situations that are beyond one's control.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Discounting the Positive:</strong> Minimizing or ignoring positive experiences or qualities and focusing only on the negative.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Emotional Reasoning:</strong> Believing that feelings reflect objective reality.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Should Statements:</strong> Using "should," "must," or "ought to" statements that create unrealistic expectations for oneself or others.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Fortune Telling:</strong> Predicting negative outcomes with certainty, even when there's no evidence to support it.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Magnification and Minimization:</strong> Exaggerating the importance of negative events (magnification) or minimizing the importance of positive events (minimization).
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Control Fallacies:</strong> Believing that one is either completely powerless or entirely responsible for everything that happens.
            </li>
